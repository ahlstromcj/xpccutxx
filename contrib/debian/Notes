Errors to figure out with both install packages:

$ sudo dpkg -i libxpccut-dev_1.0.0_i386.deb

   dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of libxpccut-dev:
    libxpccut-dev depends on libxpccut1 (= 1.0.0); however:
      Package libxpccut1 is not installed.

$ sudo dpkg -i libxpccut1_1.0.0_i386.deb

   dpkg: error processing libxpccut1_1.0.0_i386.deb (--install):
       trying to overwrite `/usr/share/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/xpccut.mo',
       which is also in package libxpccut-dev

So we remove this from libxpccut-dev.install:

   usr/share/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES/*.mo
   usr/lib/xpc-1.0/lib*.so*
   usr/lib/xpc-1.0/lib*.a
   usr/lib/xpc-1.0/lib*.la
   usr/lib/pkgconfig/*.pc

and this from libxpccut-dev.dirs:

   usr/share/locale/es/LC_MESSAGES
   usr/lib/xpc-1.0
   
Looking at the libgif4 and libgif-dev packages, here are the main
differences:

   o  /usr/lib in the dev version:

      o  Contains the *.a and *.la files, and fake *.so files
      o  Does not provide the *.so files that the non-dev version provides

   o  dev version also has the /usr/include directory.

   o The regular version also contains postinst and postrm scripts
