Description: A portable unit-test library for C and C++ libraries.
   The XPCCUT library is a cross-platform C/C++ unit-test library.
   It is meant for producing unit-test applications that are easy to
   write, easy to follow, and easy to debug.  This is the header-file
   package for libxpccut.  The files are installed into
   $prefix/include/xpccut-1.1/xpc.

Description: A portable unit-test library for C and C++ libraries.
   The XPCCUT library is a cross-platform C/C++ unit-test library.
   It is meant for producing large unit-test applications that are easy to
   write, easy to follow, and easy to debug.  It provides an options
   structure that can parse a large number of command-line options.  It
   provides a status structure that keeps track of failure and CPU times.
   It provides a unit-test framework structure that is simple, but flexible.
   Unit-test cases can be grouped, and individual test-cases can be isolated
   for debugging.  It is straightforward to wrap it in a C++ framework.  (In
   fact, one is written, to be released soon.)  It includes its own
   unit-test application (500+ sub-tests) that also serves as an example of
   usage.  It needs libpthread and libm, but these are normally present.
