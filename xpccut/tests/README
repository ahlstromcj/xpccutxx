This directory contains the C source-code files for the XPCCUT library test
application, unit_test_test.

The library source files are in the xpccut/src directory.

The header files are in the xpccut/include/xpc directory.

The "test_script" script is meant to call the unit-test application in a
number of different ways to ensure good test coverage.  Be sure to generate
the Doxygen documentation and read the pages on debugging (gdb, ddd),
profiling (gprof) and test coverage (gcov).

See the README files in all of the other XPCCUT project directories
for more information.
