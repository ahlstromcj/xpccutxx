-	Complete the support for building in Visual Studio and mingw.
-  Determine which files besides 'configure' are needed for shipping an
   installable package, and add them to git.
-  Delete these files explicitly if 'make clean' will not:
   ./contrib/Makefile.in
   ./include/xpc/Makefile.in
   ./include/Makefile.in
   ./xpc/include/xpc/Makefile.in
   ./xpc/include/Makefile.in
   ./xpc/Makefile.in
   ./xpc/tests/Makefile.in
   ./xpc/w32/Makefile.in
   ./xpc/src/Makefile.in
   ./xpchello/include/xpc/Makefile.in
   ./xpchello/include/Makefile.in
   ./xpchello/Makefile.in
   ./xpchello/tests/Makefile.in
   ./xpchello/src/Makefile.in
   ./doc/Makefile.in
   ./doc/dox/Makefile.in
   ./xpccut/include/xpc/Makefile.in
   ./xpccut/include/Makefile.in
   ./xpccut/Makefile.in
   ./xpccut/tests/Makefile.in
   ./xpccut/src/Makefile.in
-  When building out-of-source, the xpc/src/parse_ini.c:xpc_argv_from_INI()
   function fails because it cannot find 'parse_ini_test.ini'.  It expects
   to see it in the current directory, but the current directory is
   /home/ahlstrom/ca/mls/git/xpc_suite-1.1/debug/xpc/tests, while
   in a normal build it is
   /home/ahlstrom/ca/mls/git/xpc_suite-1.1/xpc/tests.
   So we need to import set_directory() and add a feature to adjust
   the 'cwd'/'pwd' accordingly.
-  In an out-of-source build (and probably in a normal build) the
   syncher_thread_ut test fails.
-  In an out-of-source build (and probably in a normal build) the
   xpc++ project has these warnings in averager and in errorlog:

   cc1plus: warning: command line option "-std=gnu99" is valid for C/ObjC
   but not for C++

   cc1plus: warning: command line option "-fgnu89-inline" is valid for
   C/ObjC but not for C++

-  In an out-of-source build (and probably in a normal build) four warnings
   like this occur:

   errorlog.hpp:112:26: warning: anonymous variadic macros
   were introduced in C99

   This can be eliminated by using -std=c++0x, -std=c++11, or
   -Wno-variadic-macros.

   However, we need to know when to apply these settings while running
   ./configure.

-  Make sure all new files are added to Makefile.am in man, etc.
-  Rename the numbering on pkgconfig directory.
-  Work out a way to choose the conformance needed to support nullptr.
-  Run "flawfinder" on every module and fix the warnings.  Also update
   functions that use xpc_strlen().
-  Resolve status of Win32 macro XPC_HAVE_ERRNO_T and the xpc-config.h w32
   files.
-  There are many targets (e.g. po-check) that made sense in the old
   directory layout, but do not now, and should go away.
-  Need to refactor the gcov/gprof targets, too, and make sure they work
   in-source and out-of-source.
-  Determine if we need to archive constructed m4 files (e.g. lt*.m4)
   because they need to ship with the 'configure' tarball.
-  Currently working on getting xpc tests to work using TESTS_ENVIRONMENTS.
