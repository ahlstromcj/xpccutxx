README for XPCCUT++ 1.1.2 (current branch = "master")

2015-10-05 to 2015-10-06

This file is the "README" for the XPCCUT++ (xpccut++) projects.  They
are:

   -  xpccut.  A simple unit-test, timing-test, and regression-test framework
      for C.  It tests itself.
   -  xpccut++.  A C++ wrapper for xpccut to make it even easier to use.

The main feature of these frameworks is that they are extremely flexible, use
functions instead of macros, and make it easy to determine where a test is
failing.

See the INSTALL file for installation (currently oriented towards developers)
and the generated PDF document for a rough outline of how to use these test
frameworks.
