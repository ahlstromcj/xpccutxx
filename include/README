README for the "include" Directory

Rather than having multiple copies of an xpc-config.h file, one per
sub-project, it makes more sense to have just one copy.

This 'include' directory is for Linux and Windows configuration files that
specifies the headers, libraries, and features available to XPC modules and
applications.

The include files in this directory are ultimately installed into system
areas where other projects (including other xpc projects) have access to
them.
