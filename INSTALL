INSTALL for XPCCUT++ 1.1.2
Chris Ahlstrom
2015-10-05 to 2015-10-06

The xpccut++ projects  use a recursive make process, and also support building
on Windows with mingw.

The documentation is provided almost exclusively in Doxygen format in
directories named "doc/dox".  One can read them directly in a text editor,
or build HTML and PDF files using the following commands:

   $ ./bootstrap
   $ ./build docs

The PDF file will be found in the xpc_basic/release/doc/dox directory.
This is the best way to understand the layout of the XPCCUT projects.

If you just want to have the libraries and test applications built and
tested, then run the following command (which also accepts an
'--enable-debug' option):

   $ ./scripts/build --test

Otherwise, run the following command to start to learn more:

   $ ./bootstrap --help

You will probably want to install the bootstrap scripts system-wide using
the --boot-install option.

Packages that must be installed (exact names may vary on your system) in
order to build this project:

   automake, autoconf, autopoint, autotools-dev, and autoconf-archive
   gcc, g++, libtool
   doxygen
   gettext
   graphviz
   texlive, texlive-latex-base
   tofrodos

# vim: ts=3 sw=3 et ft=sh
